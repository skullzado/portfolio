# My Portfolio

**NOTE:**
This portfolio website is being reworked from scratch.

This is my portfolio website made with **React** (create-react-app).

## All libraries used:

- ReactJS (create-react-app)
- React Router (react-router-dom)
- Redux Toolkit (@reduxjs/toolkit)
- React Redux (react-redux)
- Axios (axios)

## Projects included:

- Todolist (https://skullzado.github.io/projects/todolist)
- PokemonDB (https://skullzado.github.io/projects/pokemondb)

**NOTE:**
I used Redux Toolkit for PokemonDB because it's less boilerplate than Redux and easier to follow for a newb like me. I admit, together with Axios, the libraries used here is overkill for a very simple project like this.
